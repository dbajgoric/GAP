# GAP (General Autonomous Parallelizer)

**GAP** is an automatic parallelization compiler designed to produce programs targeted at massively parallel processors (for instance GPUs).
Despite its name, the compiler is currently limited to translating relatively simple C programs to their CUDA C counterparts to be run
on the CUDA enabled GPUs. However, the plan is to support other APIs and architectures in the future.

More information will be added to this document soon...
